# Kotlin Demo CLI for Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a Kotlin Version of the EDA CLI build in Rust during
the [Coursera Specialization in Rust](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-engineering-rust)
(see
implementation [here](https://github.com/amasotti/duke-rust-specialization-2/tree/main/week3/4-eda-polars-cli/eda_polars_cli))

Rust was here replaced by Kotlin, and the Polars library was replaced
by [Kotlin Dataframe](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe) library.
For parsing the CLI arguments, [Clikt](https://github.com/ajalt/clikt) was used instead
of [Clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap).
